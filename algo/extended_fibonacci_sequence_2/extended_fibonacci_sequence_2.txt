Extended Fibonacci Sequence 2

You are given a sequence of Fibonacci numbers, defined as F0 = 4, F1 = 5, and Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 for all n>1.

Define the nth term of a sequence S as Sn = Sn-1 + Fn.

Your task: 
Given n, return the last 11 digits ofi=1nSi.
Bounds: 
1≤n≤1000

Input: 
Line 1 contains a single number n.

Output: 
The output contains at most 11 digits on one line.

Sample Input:
30

Sample Output:
5702727
