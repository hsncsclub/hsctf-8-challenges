Find the coordinates of each location - now with three coordinates!

Flag format: flag{picture1 latitude,picture1 longitude,picture2 latitude,picture2 longitude,picture3 latitude,picture3 longitude}, all latitudes and longitudes to the nearest THREE decimal digits after the period, **except for picture 2, which should have TWO decimal digits. No spaces in the flag.

Example format: flag{12.862,48.066,-13.47,-48.37,-13.477,-48.376}. Picture 2 has two decimal digits, while the rest have 3.

The challenge author will not confirm individual locations, nor check your decimal digits. Three decimal digits gives a range of ~111 meters.
